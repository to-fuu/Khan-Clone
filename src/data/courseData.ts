              <h2>Algebraic Expressions</h2>
              <p>An algebraic expression is a mathematical phrase that can contain ordinary numbers, variables (like x or y), and operators (like add, subtract, multiply, and divide).</p>
              <p>Examples of algebraic expressions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>2x + 3</li>
                <li>a² - b²</li>
                <li>7xyz</li>
                <li>(p + q) / r</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Terms and Coefficients</h3>
              <p>A term is a single mathematical expression. It may be a single number, variable, or a product of numbers and variables.</p>
              <p>A coefficient is the number part of a term with a variable.</p>
              <p>For example, in the expression 3x² + 5x - 7:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>3x² is a term, and 3 is the coefficient</li>
                <li>5x is a term, and 5 is the coefficient</li>
                <li>-7 is a term (a constant term)</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Combining Like Terms</h3>
              <p>Like terms are terms that have the same variables with the same exponents.</p>
              <p>For example: 3x and 5x are like terms, but 3x and 5y are not like terms.</p>
              <p>We can simplify expressions by combining like terms:</p>
              <p>3x + 5x = 8x</p>
              <p>2x² - x² = x²</p>

              <h2>Two-Step Equations</h2>
              <p>A two-step equation is an algebraic equation that takes two steps to solve:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Use addition or subtraction to isolate the variable term</li>
                <li>Use multiplication or division to isolate the variable</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Example 1</h3>
              <p>Solve for x: 3x + 5 = 20</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Subtract 5 from both sides: 3x = 15</li>
                <li>Divide both sides by 3: x = 5</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Example 2</h3>
              <p>Solve for y: 4y - 7 = 9</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Add 7 to both sides: 4y = 16</li>
                <li>Divide both sides by 4: y = 4</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Remember, whatever operation you perform on one side of the equation, you must perform on the other side as well to maintain equality.</p>
